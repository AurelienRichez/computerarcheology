Sometimes code references address in ROM (bank switching in a2600 for instance).
The link-fixer should be able to identify addresses in code by range.

Better deployment strategy that doesn't upload everything every time.

The code references data files, but does so with relative paths. These data files should be
loaded via the classpath loader. The content and deploy, however, are NOT in the
classpath. Move site.js to the classpath and assume "content" and "deploy" are off the
current working directory.

Sweep through all links over entire site and make sure they works.
