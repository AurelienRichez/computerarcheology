The link finder should also insert/update the names too. That way the raw disassembly file has
labels that assist with the commenting process.
The link tool should add full names like {DoPrint} instead of just {}. That helps with disassembly. The link
tool overwrites these anyway.

Hardware files can have READ and WRITE labels (same address ... different functions). "IN" means read and
"OUT" means write. Easy for Z80.

Calculate limits from %%-? file. We have to load these anyway.

Tool expects "--". It should want "-2" and so on.

Sweep through all links over entire site and make sure they works.

The "address" is different from the "markup" in that the addresses in the table become targets.

Implement the Z80 and 6809 link finders.
