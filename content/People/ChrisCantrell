Whew. All the pages (except for Hurst's) have been moved over.

== April 14, 2013 ==

Moved the Zelda pages into the wiki.

The Include macro works, but I'm not sure if I want it too. I don't want the server to have to process the includes every time a viewer goes to a page with lots of included snippets. I think it makes more sense to statically copy snippets into the writeup and update them when the code changes.

Still thinking about the disassembly code jump macros. It may make sense for those to be static too.

== April 12, 2013 ==

The CA main page now redirects to the wiki. The wiki entry includes the original text and links back to the old HTML. I'll
begin migrating those sections one by one.

== April 11, 2013 ==

Worked on the "dig guide" with suggestions on structure and format. Still working on the plugins and guide.

The !AssemblyCodeMacro is just a place-holder, but it is working. I upgraded the wiki to 0.12, which has
new features. I added the graphics to the Space Invaders.

Left:
 * RAM links
 * Routine links
 * Includes for writeups

None of this is critical. We can begin migrating digs now.

Finished setting up the wiki and created a login for Patrik.

== 2/6/2013
Hosting moved to DreamHost.

== 9/25/2012
I worked on the general javascript to draw 2D pixel grids for all digs. Specifically, I found the Moon Patrol splash screen graphics.

== 9/19/2012
Moon Patrol. I did a lot of work on the graphics and colors. The game images are now drawn in their true colors, and the PROM files have been decoded.

I began decoding the two state-machines (the ISR objects and the main-loop-text objects). I completely decoded the lifecycle of a player-air-shot. Now that I have a crack in the code I'll jam in the pry bar and begin to tear it apart.

== 8/19/2012

I made lots of progress on Moon Patrol. The last 3K of the main ROM is a service-mode routine. Really this is a stand-alone program with an interactive menu that tests the hardware in concise, individual code fragments. What a great find! It makes tinkering with the hardware very easy.
I also commented the ISR routine and the complex coins-and-credits configuration code.

== 7/14/2012

Busy summer with vacation and teaching going on. I got back to the MoonPatrol service routine.

== 6/9/2012

Added the background images to the moonpatrol dig.

== 5/27/2012

More work with tiles sets. I believe I have located all of them and identified how/where they are used. The second-quest seems to use different dungeon level order. Only the code will show exactly what's going on. Too long have I lingered with drawing bitmaps. Now it is time to dig into the code.

== 5/22/2012

Lots of work in the bank3 (tiles). The pictures are cool. Hopefully this will help me find the code that uses the image tiles.

== 5/15/2012

Lots of good progress on the game tiles in Bank 3.

== 5/12/2012

I got an email from Computer Archeologist Aldo Nunez. He has been looking at the Zelda code since he was 13. He pointed me to images in banks 1 and 3.

I have been enhancing the CodeToWeb tool. It now shows the hardware registers in a different color in the listing to distinguish them from RAM addresses. I modified the code-links to allow links between the various banks.

I added "zelda.js" to render zelda tiles on an HTML5 canvas. I used this canvas feature in "zelda2.txt" (Bank2) to show the text tiles. I'll work on the other images (and the colors) in the weeks to come.

I did a little digging in Bank2.

== 4/29/2012

Back to Zelda now. Cleaned up the hardware and ram info includes. Getting ready to dig into the other banks. I don't understand the sound hardware completely. I need to come back to the audio and finalize it one day.

== 3/29/2012

Dr. Stefan Holtgen in Berlin asked me about BattleZone for the Atari2600. It has an interesting user-hit screen effect. I am digging in to see how they did that.

== 2/19/2012

I finished the CoCo and C64 Development Cartridges. These hook the old systems to a PC through the USB cable. This allows you to develop code in Eclipse on the PC and download it quickly for running on the original hardware. You can see the results on my youtube channel.

== 3/20/2011

Working on the "Game Programming on Everything" book. I am back to the Atari2600. I deployed the Missile Command initial disassembly.

== 1/26/2011

I bumped into FROTZ for iPod/iPhone/iPad. I began translating Madness and the Minotaur into zcode for play on my iPod touch. See the "Madness and the Minotaur" section for the source and zcode. Like so many things here it is a work in progress.

== 1/18/2011

Getting started back on ZELDA while I am waiting for Nintendo to release another game!

== 9/30/2010

Done with Space Invaders. I need a vacation.

== 9/21/2010

I finished commenting Space Invaders. It has been quite a challenge. I even found and verified a bug in the code. Now for the write-up.

== 7/30/2010

Making good progress in the Space Invaders dig. My original disassembly comments were not very good and often wrong. The work is slow going ... the code is like spagheti.

== 7/20/2010

I got an email from Joe Hagan with a code bug he found in Madness. I added that to the code and noted it in the write up. He also pointed out some typos in Madness and Frogger. Thanks Joe.

== 7/11/2010

I took a tangent into the Frogger sound board. Turns out there is hidden music in there, and you can hear a recording of it from the Frogger link. I took some time to compare/contrast all three sound boards with shared text in each of them. I also finished the Time Pilot specific discussion. I am just about burned out of sound board disassembly.

== 6/12/2010

I burned a LOT of time on the tool chain. I wrote the common disassembler framework for all the processors used here (excpet for the 8086 in STONED). There were lots and lots of mistakes in the disassemblies. There were places where the binary file didn't match up to the disassembly. Everything is in sync now. I can finally get back to actually doing disassembly!

== 6/4/2010

I am working on the java tool chain that generates the code and pages for this site. It is getting much better, but a lot of the pages will be broken for another week or so.

== 4/21/2010

I am knocking out the SpaceInvaders dig. I'll come back for Zelda. The SpaceInvaders disassembly text is in bad shape. I'm not sure what I used to disassemble that. The code is so fragmented. But the generated HTML version with the routine-names is helping a lot.

== 1/24/2010

Wow. The month has flown. I've been digging around in the Zelda sound code. It is all nice and tightly confined to bank 0, and a good bit of bank 0 is empty FFs. I've uncovered a lot of the individual sound effects and the songs. The code comments now include the names of the notes and the durations so pull out your piano and play along.

James Vanderhyde identified two of the sound effects. He is currently digging into Metroid. My biggest problems on this dig are 1) I never played the original and don't know what and seeing/hearing and 2) Zelda: Spirit Tracks on the DS is eating all my time!

== 12/23/2009

Now that I know the tile-numbers for the letters I wrote a program to look through the binary for strings of printed text. There are some interesting phrases mostly isolated to #2, #3, and #6. The "legend of Zelda" text is in 6.

== 12/18/2009

Making some progress in Zelda2.txt. Progress is slow.

== 12/07/2009

We watched the Nintendo Singers on Youtube again this weekend, and I preordered the new Zelda game for the DS. I have an old NES Zelda cartridge I bought to take apart and make my own NES game. The Zelda cartridge is a classic and it has a battery-backed memory area to play with. I decided to dig into the ROM a little bit. It's 128K. Thank goodness most of that appears to be data. The bank-switching process is really quite simple, and the disassembly should follow easily.

== 12/06/2009

I did some cleaning up in the SpaceInvaders code. I am going to make an 8080 emulator on the propeller chip and play SpaceInvaders on it. I need to finish the commenting to make that emulation easier to debug.

== 12/04/2009

I finished up the Bedlam discussion. That finally wraps up the Pyramid/RaakaTu/Bedlam trio. It was fun stuff, but I am ready to move on!

== 12/03/2009

I outlined the logic of the patrolling guards. That finishes up RaakaTu for now.

== 12/01/2009

I enhanced the DOCXToWeb utility. The Java program now reads DOCX files directly and creates simple HTML. The tool automatically creates a table-of-contents similar to the wiki. I added some discussion to Raaka Tu.

== 11/19/2009

I finished the "Arnstein" discussion following the evolution of the adventure-engine from Pyramid to RaakaTu to Bedlam.

== 11/1/2009

Finished the RAAKA-TU disassembly. There were several minor "upgrades" from RaakaTu to Bedlam. It is interesting to see the evolution.

== 10/31/2009

Finished the BEDLAM disassembly. I still have the write-up to do.

I made a few corrections to Madness and the Minotaur (thanks Joe Hagan)

== 10/8/2009

I have to suspend the BEDLAM dig for a couple of weeks to finish up a Circuit Cellar article. Stay tuned.

== 10/1/2009

The interpreted language in BEDLAM/RAAKATU is very rich. There are commands for storing variables. There is an IF/ELSE structure. I can't help but wonder if it wouldn't have been easier to just code it natively. Once I get the language processor disassembled I'll have to disassembled the interpreted code -- a double dig.

I am slowly deciphering the size of each command and the nesting of lists within lists. That allows me to run the java disassembler on the interpreted language and figure out what things do by the prints sprinkled through.

== 9/29/2009

What a stroke of luck! The character packing and printing follows the Pyramid2000 code almost to the opcode. That puts a huge crack in this nut. Now I can work backwards and find the print commands and then decode the packed strings themselves.

== 9/27/2009

I ran into one of my longest-known friends, Wendell Behel at the Big Spring Jam this weekend. He and I learned on the CoCo together long ago. We stood at the Jam recalling the early days. He mentioned the CoCo text game Bedlam, and that got me digging into the code.

I found the tables of input words and worked backwards to the using-code. Looks like there is a massive command scripting language within the game ... much more elaborate that Pyramid.

== 9/13/2009

Site is back up now after major reorganization. Different projects now live in their own subdirectories. This avoides name collision on the web but also makes it easier for me to work on separate projects locally. The TOOLS now include the javadocs.

== 9/8/2009

Worked a little on Atari Chess. I found the images and a couple of RAM uses. There is surprisingly little data in the code. Most of the ROM is code.

== 8/31/2009

I added the Chess dig to the Atari 2600 section. This chess program fits in 4K (half the size of Asteroids). How in the world did they make a chess AI player in so small a space?

== 8/30/2009

Better organized the dig tabs on the left of the main page.
