# Journal

## 12/27/2015

I wish I had been keeping this journal over the years. I don't know why I didn't think of it until now.

I have been working on a development cartridge for the gameboy in another repository. As part of that
I disassembled the Zelda cartridge for Computer Archeology. I made a javascript module to display
Gameboy tiles.

The week between Christmas and New Years is always Dungeons of Daggorath time. I'm sure I'll make some
progress in that disassembly -- getting the hand-commented code off of paper and into electronic form
here.
